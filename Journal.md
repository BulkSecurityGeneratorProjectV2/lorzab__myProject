##Week 2
###2/2/16
Completed:
* Sketch of what pages will look like
* Exercise
* Application flow
* Starting thinking about database tables and design
* I created the project in IntelliJ and included the log4j and junit libraries

I had issues with the negative unit tests.  At first I did not understand what to put for the negative test.  Then I had a few issues comming up with bad data or trying implement a method in the wrong way.  I think I that I have the flow of the application and layout of the screens.  I am trying to figure out all of the database tables and what I will need and all the columns needed.
