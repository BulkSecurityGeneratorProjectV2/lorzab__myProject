[Time Log](TimeLog.md)

##Week 1
###1/23/16

Completed:
* Chose a project 
* Created the repository
* Worked on Project Plan
* Started thinking how I want the web pages to look 
* Began listing technologies and how they could fit in


##Week 2
###2/2/16
Completed:
* Sketch of what pages will look like
* Exercise
* Application flow
* Starting thinking about database tables and design
* I created the project in IntelliJ and included the log4j and junit libraries

I had issues with the negative unit tests.  At first I did not understand what to put for the negative test.  Then I had a few issues comming up with bad data or trying implement a method in the wrong way.  I think I that I have the flow of the application and layout of the screens.  I am trying to figure out all of the database tables and what I will need and all the columns needed.


##Week 3
###2/9/16
This week I worked on incorporating hibernate into my application with the DAO structure.  I have one user class implemented and working and test running to check it.  I also worked on the database design and what tables will be needed.  I put together the slide presentation for my first extracurricular activity on the Radar Framework and Action-Domain-Responder architectural pattern.


##Week 4
###2/17/16
I did not get a lot done this past week with work.  However I did find the code review that we did in class extremely helpful.  I got help on the structure of my database and ideas on how to expand the application in the future.  We talked about a few different web services that could be helpful and I have found one that I am looking at and another for login with captchas to verify not a robot.  

##Week 5
This week I added login authentication to my project.  There will be two different levels of log in admin, and regular user.  The admin will help moderate site and can remove offensive comments and the users can only access their own individual reading logs they can not change anyone elses.

##Week 6
